1. Brief description of the program

-pages-
Account Creation & Login page
Main page
Accounting page

Calander page

-AC & Login page-
The AC&L page functions exactly like the one 010 taught us, it should be no problem creating this page.

-Main page-
The Main page includes the user's account balance, the most important mission and some shortcuts to other pages.
Keep in mind that every page should be one keystroke away.

-Accounting page-
The accounting page comes with the main page, where the user can make accountings.

-Budget page-
The Budget page lets the user input their own budget amount on various subjects, also provides a way for the user to manually make their own subject.

-Calander Page-
The Calander Page reads from the save file in which records. Functions like the Duolingo Calander system
